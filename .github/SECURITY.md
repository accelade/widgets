Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](../../security/advisories) of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Email**
   - Send an email to: security@example.com (replace with actual email)

- **Proof of concept** or exploit code (if possible)
- **Impact** assessment of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.

2. **Investigation**: We will investigate the issue and determine its severity and impact.

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:

- Authorized and lawful
- Helpful to our security posture
- Exempt from legal action by us

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Act in good faith
- Avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what's necessary for the report
- Report vulnerabilities promptly

## Security Best Practices

When using Accelade Infolists in your application:

### XSS Prevention

- Always escape user input in Blade templates using `{{ }}` (not `{!! !!}`)
- Be cautious when using HtmlEntry or MarkdownEntry with user content
- Sanitize HTML content before rendering

### Content Security Policy

Consider implementing a Content Security Policy header:

```php
// In a middleware
$response->headers->set('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'");
```

### Data Validation

- Validate all data before passing to infolist entries
- Sanitize file paths for ImageEntry
- Validate URLs before displaying

## Vulnerability Disclosure

After a vulnerability has been fixed, we will:

1. Release a new version with the patch
2. Publish a security advisory on GitHub
3. Update this document if needed
4. Notify users through appropriate channels

## Contact

For security-related questions that are not vulnerabilities, please open a regular GitHub issue or discussion.

Thank you for helping keep Accelade Infolists and its users safe!
